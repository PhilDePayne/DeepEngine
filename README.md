# DeepEngine
An endless-runner type game created in a self-developed engine using C++ and OpenGL

## Description
**Deeper** is an endless-runner game in which we control an astronaut traveling an infested cave. The game and the engine were made for a Problem-based learning university project using only a simple framework (as per course definition).

## External libraries
The following libraries were used in the project:

+ assimp - 3D assets loading
+ fmod - audio loading/playing
+ freetype - font rendering
+ glad - OpenGL loader
+ glfw - window/context creating, low-level input
+ glm - basic math
+ stb_image - 2d assets loading
+ imgui - UI (development only, not present in release version)
